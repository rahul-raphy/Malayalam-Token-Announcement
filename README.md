# Malayalam-Token-Announcement
This is a python program which uses gTTS for generating malayalam voice of user input. gTTS is a very  easy to use tool which converts the text entered, into audio which can be saved as a mp3 file.

To use gTTS, you would need to first convert the text of the book into a string and then pass it as input to the gTTS function. The output of the function will be an audio file containing the synthesized speech.

To play the audio file, you can use the playsound module in Python. First, you would need to initialize playsound and load the audio file. Then, you can use the playsound("file name ") function to play the audio.

Overall, the program would involve three main steps: converting the text to speech using gTTS, saving the audio file, and playing the audio using playsound.

NB: During executing the program, you need to make sure that you have a stable internet connection
